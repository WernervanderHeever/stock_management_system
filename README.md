# stock_management_system
The purpose of this project was to create a Stock Management System in the form of a client-server application.

This application is useful to both client as well as managers. Managers can gain access to this application if they log on with their respective username and password. Managers can view current stock and orders that has not been shipped as well as update the current stock. Clients have to log in with their client id to gain access to this application. 
This project consists of two application and a database. The client application sends SQL queries over to the server which is connected to the database using a MySQL Connection/C++. The server sends these queries to the database, and returns the result to the client application.
The database consists of four tables (managers, product, client, order). These tables hold the information necessary for the end users to use this application. 
The manager table hold the username and password for all managers using this application, and is only used to validate whether a user is a manager or not. The product table holds the name of the product, current stock level and price. The client table holds the clients id to validate whether the user is a valid client. The order table is the intersection table between the product and the client table. The client table describes the quantity of products to be delivered and whether the order has been delivered or not.
